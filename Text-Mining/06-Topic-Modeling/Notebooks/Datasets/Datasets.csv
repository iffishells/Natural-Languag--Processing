1,"The hotel it is fantastic built by the sea, living together with nature. Environment it is great as well as people and service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We full enjoyed the place, and facilities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks for the ""cidreira"" and ""madalenas"" tea at reception"
2,One dream! Cozy  and comfortable Hotel!  The best personalized one! All the employees are congratulated! Very nice taste
3,"Hotel concept is hard to grasp. They communicate environmental sustainability, through fashionable buzzwords like upcycling but they use pillows made out of duck feathers!?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pricing is utterly ridiculous, for what you get.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Breakfast has high-quality products, but it lacks in choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service is friendly, although ""too friendly"" at times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overall experience was ok, but you can get much better alternatives for lower prices."

11,     It's one of the most beautiful places we have been to - magical world. Speechless & full of grace� Thanks to the team of Areias do Seixo for this wonderful stay!        
12,     Thanks for the stay in this wonderful Hotel.        
13,     A five star stay
14,     One dream. Coming back again is not even a question. Yes
15,"Joana: thank you for being always available. Claudia: thank you for your grace and support Filipe: thank you for your smile and joy for life. Kiki: your bread is to die for and your care and through your green goddess juice was touching, as well as your presence and power. Leonardo: thank you for creative flair and for accommodating our special requests in a natural way making us feel at home. Maria: thank you for your senility in asking ""May I enter?"" and for always carrying a warm smile. Sergio: your cave and warmth was a gift    Our gratitude to you all for all that you give. Thank you Areas Do Seixo for all of your light, your giving, your spaciousness and timelessness. We felt genuinely cared for from a place of love and generosity, far beyond the call of duty. From the interior design to the food, from the sunlight to the connection with nature, everything seems to be riding on a very special energy. If Heaven now and then touches the Earth, it does at Areas Do Seixo.        "
16,"     We had a truly memorable and delightful stay at Areas do Seixo. After some difficulty in finding it (GPS was helpful), we knew the moment we walked in that this was a special place. The sign for the turn off was quite small, the front door was locked, but immediately opened. Definitely a secluded retreat on a holiday weekend (we checked in on Jan. 1). The seating at the check in desk was swings. Below the clear floors was water. Through the windows you could see the grass roofs of the below-street-level rooms. Each room is unique, we were told. Ours featured a bathroom with a sunken tub/shower, a window for a ceiling, an olive tree growing, and a fireplace. You get the idea. It may not be for everyone, but for us, we got our money's worth. We appreciate innovation, design, beauty, and seclusion. Areas do Seixo had it all. Look at the photos and see if it might be for you too. It is a splurge for sure. But they deliver. For us, Post Ranch Inn in Big Sur, California is the only place that has come close. One note: thank goodness for TripAdvisor's quote service - we found the room only on Despegar.com, which we found from TripAdvisor.        "
17,"     We were totally charmed by the Hotel. A unique place, a magical atmosphere that invite relax and relax! A real change of scenery! We were impressed by the architecture of the hotel and its total integration with nature. The Neha Crotchet room was absolutely perfect  with a sublime decoration (as in the whole hotel). Breakfast was delicious and balanced, very fresh and varied. The same for the restaurant. We went impressed by the quality of the products, their freshness, beautiful tasty and original dishes. The staff either at reception as in the restaurant was lovely. We thank the kitchen staff for offering bread that we could bring home. The floral massage spa was very nice and full. And yoga was top! In short, it was an unforgettable experience in a magical place. We will come back, for sure! We also loved the music played in the hotel, what is your playlist? ,,,,,,,,,,
Another big thank you for all the team!         "

""Once in a while one can find excellent 5* hotels, well located, clean, comfortable and with all the amenities. We've found and enjoyed some of these around the world. Not so often you come across hotels that go beyond this and make you question everything else you've seen and experienced. This is one of them. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The photos on the site surely don't express all the attention to detail and the harmony in the choices, the simplicity of the materials and the smell of natural essences all around. The care we received as guests and all the personalized treats made us feel at home among friends and in our opinion rank this hotel as one of the best, relaxed places in Portugal and in the world, and a sure return destination.""        "
21, A magical place! Every single detail seems to be well thought. Spend the night there and have dinner in the restaurant
22," The restaurant, under the command of Chef Leonardo Pereira, who worked several years in ""Nomad"" in Dina mark is absolutely wonderful. Food is made with a lot of love and respect for nature. They have their own garden, where ingredients are taken. Amazing, delicious, tasty food, which makes us happier every time a dish is served.     We went to the Hotel Areas do Seixo to have lunch in the restaurant�When we arrive we have notice the modern architecture, clean and extremely cozy. The place has an amazing energy, which makes us to look on every single detail. A unique service, people from all over the world working and interact though guests. This place makes us to feel like we are in our friend's homes. I want to come back to this magical place.        "
23, Considering the entire experience
24, Areas do Seixo is a magical place. The restaurant makes part of it
25,     My co-workers loved this place and its service! Congratulations! Next time it will be really hard to find a place that could overcome this one!! Some of them even ask if they decide to go on a personal weekend you could make a special price. One more time a big thank!        
26, Food very original and genuine
27, In the restaurant
28,"     Dear Areas do Seixo team: we have no words to describe the wonderful place, magically decorated and the nicest customer service - I guess we dare say, a 'family-type' service, since all of you welcomed us as greatly as possible, in such a warm and elegant style.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We hope that this project and team continue to grow, but always keeping the warmth that only a boutique and charming hotel like this can offer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank you very much for a memorable stay, please accept our most sincere greetings       "
29,      Everything good. To repeat one day
30,"     The hotel is in its whole a fantastic experience. Beautiful architecture, interior d�cor absolutely fascinating, full of little details standing for difference. The staff is extremely nice and with excellent skills in guests communication (police, nice and discrete). With any doubts an experience to repeat. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last note, we loved the cinema room. Excellent film selection and excellent idea.   One think not as good, it was the restaurant. It took too long to the order to arrive (the employee come to apologize constantly), the monkfish come already cold and the quality/price relation is a bit unbalanced.     Starting by the best parts, the noise in Jasmin room. The fire place was all night making noises making it hard to sleep. If when we have put pillows to avoid the sound. We took several house to fall asleep, and didn't rest properly. We have just slept 3 hours and just after the wind noise go away. After that we were awake for the employees with the breakfast to the next room.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The doors don't isolate the sound as they should, we have heard the employees to  whisper. The next time I consider to make a reservation I will demand a quiet room ( with shame because the room is gorgeous)."
31, The restaurant is excellent
32,     After a long wait (my reservation was done back in September)

36,"    I bless for Marta from SPA, one of the best massages I have ever had. My stay has overcome expectations, the hotel is fantastic, dedicated staff and passion for their jobs. An experience to repeat in this unique and different place. Congrats to all for the excellent work, quality and kindness. You can improve the use of ""Villas"", creating conditions for people to reserve it in the future.         "

Last Sunday we were a group of three people to have lunch at your restaurant, in which we have chosen the tasting menu. The meat dish served was a partridge with celery puree, and sure that the kitchen team will recall, one of the dishes was sent back because the partridge's breast was blood, had not been cooked properly. It turns out that in my case also happened the same, with the partridge breast arrived at the table quite rare and  including raw in the center. For my stupidity I decided not to speak too, and even (through ignorance, I confess) thought it might be that even the intention of the chef, similar to what happens with the pigeon breast, which should be served rare. At a bad time I did, because since yesterday that I meet food poisoning by salmonella strong enough. The purpose of my contact is passing this information to the kitchen and especially the Chef Leonardo Pereira. The balance of the meal was very positive, but was stained by this incident. Mistakes happen to everyone, but I think in this case it was serious, the consequences that happened (I am unable to work since yesterday, that being the owner of a small restaurant, brings a lot of problems), and the fact that in matters of food security should be redoubled. I have no intention to harm a project that I consider having much merit, because the wanted to do had done this ""complaint"" on social networks rather than do hereby.     "
156," We were 3 and we all ordered the Tasting Menu. The menu was excellent, and Chef Leonard has to be congregated.       ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last Sunday I went with some friends to have lunch at your hotel restaurant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfortunately, the same can not be said of your waitress. After we ordered the tasting menu, I asked him if there was (apart from the choices of the letter), any proposal for the Food Pairing menu. He told me that yes, that was a proposal tailored to each menu (since vary with some frequency), among whites, reds and dessert. When I asked what the price per person of this option, informed me that would be � 25 (per person).,,,,,,,,,,
We were served several wines by the glass during the meal (2 white, 2 red and 1 dessert). The Food Pairing went better in some than in other dishes, and we had the opportunity to discuss with the waitress how challenging some of the dishes were.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So far so good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The problem, and it's always unfortunate when this happens, when we emerged shows the account (you can see a picture of it attached). Instead of the expected � 75 wine (� 25 x 3), which after all we were charged were 12 glasses of wine, as if they had been ordered � la carte separately. Now was not that any of this was the ""sold out"", having a considerably higher cost (� 114 vs. � 75).,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It wasn't a weekend nice meal, and always mark the experience we had. Given the hotel operation level, I do not think such situations are acceptable.     "

I am delighted with you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I want to thank the whole attention and kindness during my stay at Areas do Seixo. I really enjoyed the hotel and the service. It is splendid!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yesterday I drive to the restaurant ""Areas do Seixo"" to enjoy the peace and praised the quality of the environment and flavors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, I had not made a reservation, while browsing the site (after reading the Evas�es magazine about the reopening), I did not get the idea that it was necessary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Regards the chef Leonardo Pereira authorized an exception and we could have lunch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are no words to express the gratitude for the kindness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then it was a memorable dining experience ... Since the care and education of employees, the combination of flavors, the friendliness of the chef Leonardo Pereira. Who kindly presented us with a surprise dessert.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On our way home to NYC we spoke with an English couple about your hotel and they were already looking it up and planning when they can go!  Obrigado        
165,     Congratulations to Areas do Seixo
166,"             Your policy against children make me choose for children.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You are gay-friendly, anti-bullfighting friendly, zen-friendly, trendy-friendly friendly smoking, I regret that children are to you and to the guests such a nuisance! Children are not aliens, they are of this world and have the same right to enjoy and attend the same places, it is regrettable that they are such a nuisance when I spent 40 years of my life to passively endure the smoke and the addiction of others in public places, it is doubly unfortunate because we are a country with the world's smallest birth rate, but that does not respect the children."
167,"     We would like to congratulate you and all of your team for this perfect break we get.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hope to come back as soon as possible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
        "
168,"             I have contacted your unit since I've made the reservation through Booking, selecting for this purpose the option of 2 adults and 1 child from 0 years, whereby it was presented to me the result of the quarter for which I made the reservation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also in the Booking and additional information of the room in question, state that ""children as young as 10 years are welcome"" with a ""rate of 80 �"" and birthplace of placement ""subject to availability"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once children as young as 10 years do not sleep in the cradle and I was allowed to make the booking to the end, the conclusion reached is that children under 10 years do not pay fee of 80 � but the cradle can not this ensured (situation is not raise me any problems since it could lead to my child travel bed).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To my amazement after the reservation indicating to the credit card data received the information below, which is not realized. Then I went on your website and later called:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do not see anywhere reference in your site a ban on children under the age of 10 years in the rooms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The reference in the Booking children from the age of 10 are welcome means that those who had lower age are not welcome?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The telephone clarification they gave me does not allow children under 10 years in the room not to disturb the rest of the other guests as the hotel's concept is relaxation. But alternatively suggested to me one of the Villas with the minimum total amount is around � 600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We were therefore faced with a prejudice against age and, worse still, given the price disparity, we face discrimination, since the price of the reservation of the Villas is double the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Also not mentioning this explicitly discrimination anywhere on your site or on Booking and allow reserves to be completed only after informing the discriminatory policy and your present alternatively a different type of accommodation that is not only different as costs double , is not an alternative.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So that's why I feel angry and cheated by you, I ask response to this complaint by the same way I inform you that I will submit complaint with regulatory authorities Tourism."
169," The food was good also if I ate only salad the whole 3 days, but I couldn't get enough of it. Yesterday I had two because yesterday they were a bit smaller than normally, but it was okay. The garlic bread that I ordered and which was not on the list was more than perfect, you should add it definitely to your menu list! I think guests would like it! Well, maybe also not, if only one of the couples wants to eat the garlic bread ,-)! But it was perfect! BREAKFAST: - perfect! I found everything what I wanted, I missed only the Latte Macchiato ,-) I ordered it twice but got two different things to drink in the morning. Once I got a macchiato and once a cappuccino. But that was fine too!,,,,,,,,,
One minus-point: The coffees are just way too hot! (I'm Italian and we drink lots of coffee... and your coffee is definitely served too hot!! Try it ,-)),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everybody was nice. But Felipe and Sergio (i guess the names are right) are two perfect bartenders! Felipe's flirty and chatty art is far away to top in the restaurant! We enjoyed it when he served us!    SPA: Massage: Heaven!!!! Wow! So sorry that we didn't see Tine this morning. She was perfect! We enjoyed every minute and every detail in your hotel. The rooms are superb, the decoration is heavenly in every part of the hotel, compliments. I think, besides the people, the decoration and the interior design is the most important thing here and its perfect! I came for that  and I found all that what I wanted to see -  not only in the pictures of the website! Which doesn't happen all the time in hotels!   One of the girls in the restaurant sometimes seemed to have a bad day. Not all the time, but sometimes we thought that she didn't really wanted to work right now.     PEDI/MANICURE: Not worth the money! I do get lots of mani/pedis in Hotels but this one was definitely not worth the money. But I should have said STOP immediately when I saw the women entering the room because I looked at her nails (which were kind of eaten and than at her feet - some with naipolish, some without some with a bit of it still on it)... The women, I forgot her name, was really nice and friendly but the treatment was not perfect at all. The color was on my skin besides the nails of my fingers and on the feet she didn't take away dead skin, and, the bit what she did was only with the ""razor-thing"" (which of course is quicker...)  and not with the normal products that everybody is used too.  You should think about getting another one to do that. It is not professional at all! "

We stayed for two nights and starting about the  the hotel itself, the rooms, the decorative elements, the environment and the staff was very impressive! Remarkably, we wish come back anytime, that's why our conclusion can only be: a big thumbs up ! I enjoyed particularly  the relaxed atmosphere and hassle free! Luxury and no tie dinner, we like that! The path to the beach is also an experience, such as the beach itself! The room was simply to feel good! The spa area was tastefully decorated, we enjoyed the steam room and massage treatments.        "
212,     Fantastic service
213,"     We stayed here for a short stay after a trip to Lisbon. In the future we'll certainly stay longer. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The location and grounds were perfect, the rooms even better and finally the staff still beating both of those. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The restaurant opened us to new foods and ways to present them. The drinks were fantastic and the beach was beautiful. The walk from the hotel to the ocean was through dunes with colorful vegetation ending with a tremendous view of the waves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We hope to make it a regular place to stay in the future.        "
214,"     ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A totally different place, a real calm bubble. Hotel characterized as full of design, mineral and vegetable. Our room on the ground floor, overlooking the sea was very spacious with an amazing bathroom with fireplace and olive. We found this very environmental friendly place.        "
215,    Amazing SPA in all ways        The hotel is located practically in a meadow of flowers that culminates in a stunning series of sand dunes. The rooms are big and bright: they managed to give the idea of ??being outdoors. Our room had an outdoor hot tub and that was finely decorated. The outline level absolutely nothing to say. However
216,     An absolutely magic stay in this unique place. All surroundings
217,"     Dear all, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We really enjoyed our stay and like to come back very soon!!!        "
218,"     My husband and I had an AMAZING time at your hotel on our honeymoon. Every detail was perfect! The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, the staff was fabulous, and the food was simply amazing! We ate at the restaurant all three nights we stayed at the hotel and could not get over how delicious everything was! And the fact that the menu changed every day was just icing on the cake. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our hotel room was stunning, and our private patio was so relaxing. Having a view of the gardens, the sand dunes, and the ocean all at once was magical. We had the most relaxing stay and cannot wait to return!         "
219,"     Last Thursday we�ve stayed in Areas do Seixo and our stay has truly been amazing. We were impressed by the beauty of the hotel and kindness of all your employees. Together with the incredible nature and ecological environment, the experience was complete. Being in Areas do Seixo was an incredible experience and herewith we�d like to thank all of you for making our trip even more unforgettable. Please, do not see this as negative, because we really, really enjoyed staying in your hotel. These were just the points that we thought might be improved to create an even better experience for other guests.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks again so much, it has been amazing.   In our opinion the menu for dinner was quite limited. We know the concept it�s based on the products in the garden (which we really like!), but we can imagine for some guests the choice might be too limited. The jacuzzi was dirty when we got in, which might be blamed on the fact that there wasn�t a roof above the place where the tub was situated. We stayed in Oliviera Princesa and it seemed to be the only room without a roof / roofwindow above this area.     We missed a garbage bin in the hotel room. There was only 1 (tiny) bin in the toilet, and we missed a garbage bin in the sleeping area. "
220," The restaurant, the place yesterday evening was so gorgeous. Many thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everyone was so impressed and they really enjoyed the evening.            "

260,     We really enjoyed: the relaxed atmosphere
261,     Wonderful stay
262," The restaurant, either for breakfast or dinner is from an unusual quality. The breakfast  schedule is something more hotels would adopt because it makes perfect sense. In addition, the fact that someone who prepares the eggs and bacon on request is stupendous. As for dining service, there are no words. I confess that I was very curious because Chef Leonardo Pereira expectations were not completely dashed. It should be noted the courage to have an open kitchen to the living room where you do not hear anything and that everything works almost like an orchestra. Spectacular!   As for the spa, the Moroccan theme is quite interesting. The quality of the massage and sympathy of both masseurs was quite high and I will repeat as soon as possible. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Having no account on TripAdvisor, I decided to email my experience with my wife.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Starting with the staff, only words of gratitude. Despite being a charming, 5-star hotel, the staff strives for sympathy and the unpretentious which in our view only promotes and elevates the hotel to another level. I have to thank all team.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The room, the sea, is stupendous. It has almost endless views and waking up to a view like that is almost one of the best pleasures in the world. In addition, the treats left in the room as those salty squares (DIVINAL!) And cookies elevate their quality. Attention to detail, such as the lighting of candles in the evening was also to our liking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just feel sad because the time have been little hot to be able to sunbathing by the pool, but of course that there is nothing they could have done to improve. I can only wish that everything continues to go well and you to keep your quality and sympathy, because in the end, that's what makes the difference."
263,"            Good morning, I would like to share my experience with you. Despite the natural beauty where the hotel belongs, I was quite disappointed with the service in general. First , I came to spend my anniversary and no one had the attention to wish me congratulations, by mail I had been suggested different packs and I had not any. Personal  not very sympathetic and our room ""Terra"" two nights only once was ready for bed. Cleaning generally leaves to be desired ... the end not felt well and I will not recommend. "
264," Your restaurant and bar service is absolutely top    Following  your suggestion .... here is my review:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I checked-in in your hotel on 21  and checked-out on 22 June.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We marvel at your concept, the mix and balance between nature, the cement and the predominant material in the d�cor (wood), is exceptional.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very cute and nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very well equipped .... not having felt any lack.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Regarding the employees: Friends, from the receptionist, bar service, restaurant service, kitchen service, informality (in the form of being and dressing) and proximity to the customer is anything that makes us feel at home family.,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really enjoyed the ""Joanas"", S�rgio Filipe, Gilberto Lucas (Great ""Chef"") Carina (inexhaustible power) and not forgetting that for these faces to shine there is always an entire ""staff"" that makes it appear to be very easy keep an entire structure, working properly oiled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A big Thanks to all and I assure outset that I will (I have done on Facebook) heartily recommend to all friends, acquaintances and clients to lodge in my local area located in St. Benedict / Chiado.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best of luck the ""Sands of Pebble""        "
265,     We loved the room
266,"     I will if you give me your sourdough recipe!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Honestly, your hotel is absolutely amazing and I will go onto tripadvisor. When we came 2 years ago the food was the only let down but it is truly spectacular now.  But really well done, just incredible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We will be back. The only thing we could find complaint with, if you do want feedback and this is tiny but your cutlery is very uncomfortable to hold!!"
267,"Dear  Daniella. Just back home after a very nice roundtrip in north and central Portugal.   We specially want to thank you for our  fantastic stay in your hotel.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Next time we really hope to stay longer in Santa Cruz beach.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After travelling the world round  finally we discovered that  heaven  exist ( but only )  on earth and in Portugal haha ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Be sure that we will inform our colleagues specialized  in �  Vip Travel �   in Belgium. Once again 1000 x thanks."
268,     You have asked for our feedback on our stay (one night on June 18). We found your hotel excellent and everything was impeccable. Our only concern is that there's not much in the area
269,"     I hereby give my opinion regarding our day stay June 21,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was a month ago chose the Areias do Seixo to spend our first honeymoon night and nothing could have been better. It was really magical. You do have a place where time stands still, where the beauty is unparalleled. And we always thought about going back and so was.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
        A year later we returned to celebrate that date and we faced an extremely unpleasant situation. When we met in the tub all was well until we turn the jacuzzi and immediately came a nauseating smell and we had to get out of the tub immediately. Baffled by the situation we were watching the water and this was in full of green slime coming out of air vents through which the bubbles are formed. Later when we passed by the reception we reported the event to the employee very gently and shocked by what she had told asked immense apology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In conclusion meant that incidents do happen although this shows a lack of care by the maintenance of the resort. As described on booking.com: ""Get the celebrity treatment with world-class service at Areas Do Seixo Charm Hotel & Residences"". With this it creates a great expectation treatment. And so we were surprised with the result of our complaint was only an apology. Like any other couple travel a lot and already we passed many hotels and in the middle of so many positive experiences from time to time happen less pleasant situations but has always given us an apology followed by attention to the client. Thing not obtained by the Areias do Seixo and which left us a bit disappointed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With regard to your request to share our experience with the tripadvisor consider doing it before but we wanted to give you our feedback."
270,"     I would like to thank you so much for everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last weekend my parents celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary in your hotel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They told me, it was fantastic and the best gift ever, from my sisters and I.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall we loved our visit to Areas do Seixo and definitely plan to return. The location is wonderful, the accommodation superb and the service was excellent. Many thanks to all of the staff who made our visit so enjoyable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overall though, as I say, we loved our stay and definitely plan to return in future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
   In terms of constructive feedback, the only other comment I would make is that we found the evening meals dragged on too long. We stayed for three evenings and found we were left waiting for our food too long during the evenings of Sunday 5th and Tuesday 7th July. The restaurant was extremely busy on each evening. The waiters appeared to be focused on other tables and we were not afforded the opportunity to order additional drinks in between courses. On the evening of Tuesday 7th July, I also had to help myself to cutlery for dessert. We really enjoyed the food which was of an extremely high quality and stood out for its freshness, but it struck me that on each evening the kitchen was a little overwhelmed. In terms of addressing this, I wonder if it might help to remove the tasting menu - it seemed that this proved too much of a distraction and overwhelmed the kitchen with knock-on effects for other diners.     "
273,"     Thank You Joana, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a wonderful stay at the hotel (I didn't want to leave). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

274,"     Dear Areas do Seixo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My husband and I stayed with you in the 7 Sentidos room on 15 June. We had such a lovely time! We loved everything, from the room, the facilities, the food, the friendly staff to your spa treatments. We had a fantastic experience. We are looking forward to coming back for another visit next year, but for longer next time. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the room, we especially loved the mix of relaxing music that you played through your sound system. We enjoyed it so much we are wondering if you sell a CD of your music or if you know where we can buy your playlist from and what it's called, please?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thanks again for looking after us so well.         "
275,As has always been a pleasure travel to your hotel
276,"     We had a wonderful stay at Areas do Seixo and we loved the decoration, the atmosphere, the amenities and the food.        � Our mattress was relatively old and had a curved shape, which made the sleep uncomfortable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
� The extra-beds for the kids were making noise at every move, which also disrupted our sleep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
� The price charged for such extra-beds was completely outrageous (� 160.- !)."
277,"     We had a marvelous stay at Areas do seixo. Everything was great. We were welcomed by a drink with pie, then drive to our room ""Oliveira Princesa"" : a wonderful bathroom with 2 showers, a jacuzzi, .....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The room is large, beautiful with a very nice view on the garden, the dunes and the sea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is everything you need: 2 hats, a basket,an ombrelle to go to the sea, not far( 15 minutes  walk). The beach is great, not much people, a rescue team, waves, sand.,,,,,,,,,,
In the evening, before going to the restaurant, you can take a glass of wine ( offers ) near a fire, outside. It is really magical!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The restaurant is very good and breakfast great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So this was a really wonderful stay, everything was done to that, and the staff was really kind and nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was difficult to leave after 3 days there, but I hope we will come again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expectation was high as compared to existing assessments. We found a great hotel: beautiful, well decorated and very comfortable.     However, objectifying the consolidation of excellence, we think it will be to review the cleaning some glasses of the Restaurant.   "

I was delighted with what I heard on the different plants used for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Congratulations to your team and management, it would be good to spread to more areas of the country.            "
281," Also, the staff in the restaurant (floor and chefs) , out of this world. As someone who has close connections with the hospitality industry, we were absolutely blown-away with the dining experience.     We had a fantastic stay. We have reviewed (5 stars) on TripAdvisor, it should be up in the coming days under the user name, Mattje7.,,,,,,,,,,,,
One thing we were a bit surprised by (not mentioned in the TripAdvisor review) is the nightclub next to the property.  There was no air conditioner in the rooms, it was hot, we tried to have the door looking out to the garden open but had two problems (1) mosquitos and (2) the ""duff duff"" base from the club next door. As I am sure you are aware (because the hotel staff were) it goes till 9am on a Sunday morning. Not very relaxing or picturesque. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not sure there is anything you can do about this issue going forward, just thought would bring it to your attention. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Best to you and the hotel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have just returned from our holidays in Portugal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We want to thank you again very much for the great dinner we have had at Areas do Seixo!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What you and your team are doing is simply fantastic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was one of the best meals we have ever had!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And Leonardo, we have seen a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seeing you and your team at work in the open kitchen was an inspiring sight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am very enthusiastic about how you bring innovation to the Portuguese cuisine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Light and easily digestible, surprising and full of flavor. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was simply blown away by your cooking and I wanted it to let you know that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are looking forward visiting you again soon!            "
284,"We spend nice moment to Areas do seixo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We were for about 12 days on villa 2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We found really nice:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- The hotel and the garden, specially the vegetable garden.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- The walk to go to the beach and the beautiful beach.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- The team is really friendly, also the cook and the cleaning ladies .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- The delicious breakfast, the wonderful salads and sandwiches at lunch and also the fantastic diner.Anyway, we keep a really nice memory of our stay by you.    We found not nice:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-The price of vegetarian menu ( for diner) is to expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-The vegetarian main course looks some times more as a starter than a main course.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

285,"Hello,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We had a great time at Areas do Seixo. We especially liked the hotel's design, each individually designed spacious room with a beautiful terrace, candles in the rooms, fireplace.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We also have very good memories of the reception staff and touched by the little touches, we were treated to some delicious lemongrass wires.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We hope to see you in the meantime, we will advise the hotel around us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Thanks again,   Little choice options in dinner menu.     "
286,     We had a wonderful time at your hotel though we only stayed for one night. We will certainly be back.        
287,"       I email you secretly from the ""7 senses"" room, since I booked this hotel as a surprise for my new husband. We got married 2 days ago in Amsterdam and are here on our honeymoon as I emailed with you repeatedly (I also spoke on the phone several times with the reception desk). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am a little bit disappointed since until now I don't have the feeling that we are on our honeymoon and I would really like a little surprise for my husband (just a note or sign would be great) to remind us of our honeymoon (as we discussed on the phone, maybe I should have contacted you just before the weekend, but I did trust that my request was noted by you).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You think it is still possible, a little late but just a small sign that we are just married, that's why I booked with you guys :) you looked like a real honeymoon hotel.      "
288,"     Some news as promised. My wife was at the Cuf Infanto Santu hospital until Thursday 6/08. She finally had an myocarditis, which is less than an infarct, but still important.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We came back to Belgium Saturday 8/08. Now she has to recover and see a lot of doctors again !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We would like to thank you a lot for your help and kindness in our difficult moment. Areas do Seixo is a fantastic place even it's there that happens the problem of my wife.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a virus caused by her gastroenteritis which went to her heard and was making big trouble.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The welcome of the hotel, the place, the philosophy, the food, everything is perfect in Areas do Seixo.        "
289," Breakfast: The choices were wonderful and it was like being in someone�s kitchen helping ourselves to food.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dinner: We had tasting menu. All dishes were so creative and tasty. We also like the way each chef serving their own dishes to tables rather than waiters going back and forth the kitchen and floor. It added to the taste that we could see the chefs cooking in their open kitchen.     We are writing to give you our feedback on our stay at your hotel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We stayed in one of your villas facing the sea for 4 nights.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was our first time to Portugal and we can�t tell you enough how amazing the whole trip was.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We always travel all over Asia, Europe and USA every year based in London and we can confidently say this was one of the best experiences we�ve had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Staff (receptionist, kitchen staff, waiters, waitresses, house keepers): All so extremely personal, friendly, smiley and helpful.,,,,,,,,,,,
Villa: The design was at its best and the cleanness of the villa was second to none. Towels were all soft as new and the bedlinen was so white and crisp with homely duvet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The design of the villa was practical and beautiful. The decorating style was so inspirational. We loved using the well equipped kitchen with bbq facility outside. The kitchen was all immaculate, didn�t have any trace of other people who stayed and used the facility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Garden: It was natural and loved the veg garden. We bumped into one of the staff who was picking vegetables for the kitchen and she kindly offered us some herbs for our bbq and even sent someone to our villa to give us a box of garden vegetables. We were so grateful and happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 When we went back to our villa after dinner, our beds were turned beautifully, candles were lit everywhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We can not wait to go back to the hotel again and we do hope the quality of things we mention above will be kept well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We thank you so much for looking after us so well and we are grateful for the sweetest memories you gave us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Look forward to seeing you again.        "
290,"     We enjoyed our honeymoon in Areas do Seixo  lot. Location, architecture and decoration are fantastically beautiful. Breakfast and dinner were perfect. ( Would it be possible to get the recipe for the caramelized white chocolate and the cauliflower & olives ?),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The staff was very friendly and engaging.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two tiny suggestions.  No complaint � just help for grow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please excuse my bad English , I hope it will be better up to our next visit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  A little bit more professionalism at the front desk would be desirable. For example, booking a rental car should be possible without difficulty. If you spend several days at the hotel the menu repeats. It would be nice, if the choice would be expanded slightly, or the guests would be noted.     "
291,"     Stayed 2 nights. Somewhat a strange place with all luxury amenities you would like combined with the hippie dressed staff who all seem like they are slightly high, yet they are very professional and helpful. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We booked late and did not get a room with a nice view, but with a secluded small garden and an amazing outdoor shower. Bed was soft and comfortable and with a proper duvet. A wonderful beach is a short walk away and this part of the Portuguese coast is amazing for surfing. Pool and hotel grounds are amazing. Breakfast had a lot choices and dinner was also excellent. Would definitely come back.        "
292,"     Filled with tasteful, small details and sophisticated elegance, Hotel Areas do Seixo was an amazing discovery. An absolutely inspiring place where just a fantastic room for a window size than we can see and found a blue sea by front of us !!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Delicate and super staff available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Price above average, but a UNIQUE experience !!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We liked.        "
293,"             Having heard about this hotel we drove one hour from Lisbon to check for ourselves!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On our arrival, and before my husband had got out of the car an employee called from the door and asked if we needed help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I replied that we would need advice, when my husband was able to discuss.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The said employee seemed reluctant either to offer us any information or to let us into the hotel. Finally inside she said that we could not look round the hotel and pool as they had,""A Group"".,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I then asked to see a menu she told me that the menu was so many courses at such a price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The result therefore of our journey to evaluate the hotel was zero.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For my next visit to a top star hotel, in September, I shall avoid this one and shall go to one where I receive a gracious welcome."
294,     We have seen and experienced many hotels but what the Areas do Seixo offers surpasses everything. An incredibly exciting
295,"     Pro:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our gold room,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Beautiful beach nearby ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Swimming pool ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Designer interiors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delicious breakfast - homemade bread and local products  We had to carry our heavy luggages from the bus stop (2km to the hotel ). We called the reception but no one could help us ordering a taxi or shuttle.  Some staff were not nice - like the bold guon in the restaurant.     "
296,"     5 th visit and still the very best of Portugal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just spent 5 nights in the most perfect room which I can't pronounce.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Returning next week for another three nights.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The wonderful people behind the bar in the restaurant and at reception have become our very good friends, nothing is too much trouble and the attention to detail is fantastic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many will try and imitate this spectacular Eco hotel but as we have found all of them have fallen short.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The new beach bar called Noah just a 20 minute stroll down the beach is a wonderful addition to an already perfect place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep up the great work guys you can't keep us away!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love to you all.        "
297,"     Areas do Seixo is truly special and you will realize it in every little aspect from the moment you enter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The architecture of the whole resort is modern yet personal and functional. Every little corner is designed with much love and attention to detail. The lighting at night provides a nice romantic atmosphere. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our room (#5) was very spacious with a big bath tub, a great chimney and an open bath room as the main highlights. The hotel's own music channel is also worth mentioning, it provided constant high quality relaxation tunes. We also liked the terrace with loungers which was open to the garden yet providing enough privacy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The service was second to none. You could really tell that each employee is proud to work there and genuinely friendly and welcoming. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We would definitely recommend the experiences they offer. The bonfire with music and wine was very enjoyable. We also did the tea experience in which you can create your own tea from their garden. Renting bikes is also a good idea to explore the fantastic wild dunes and beaches. And all three options were for free!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The breakfast has a big variety of very fresh food. If you don't find meat on the buffet, just order it.   Dinner is maybe the only reason for some small criticism. While the daily menu (3 starters and 3 mains plus a tasting menu) is always very inventive and made of the freshest organic ingredients, it can get at times a bit too eclectic and sophisticated. Why not just adding a few classic dishes to the menu if one feels less fancy? After having spoken with other guests this limited choice seems also to be a concern for families with kids.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The solution to this (small) issue is to drive 5min to Noah, a fantastic brand new beach house in Santa Cruz. They do amazingly fresh fish and seafood dishes at reasonable prices. Furthermore it is a great place to chill at the beach or to learn surfing.     "
298,     Was blown away by our stay! Stayed 2 nights. Staff and service were incredible. They took care of our every need. Food and drinks were amazing! Everything from the coffee to the salads grown right on the property were excellent. If you want to treat yourself and someone you love to a perfect get away this it.        
299," The food is beyond delicious.     This is a slice of paradise. Johanna s Johanna j and Philippe ensure that your stay is just magical. The common areas are gorgeous. Think the chicest coolest commune you'll ever be witness too. The attention to detail form the swings at reception to strategically placed bonfire from which to stargaze to the beautifully appointed furnishings throughout the hotel are too numerous to mention. The Eco sustainability to all the components of the hotel are an added bonus. The chef comes from directly from noma and the food is directly cultivated from their garden of which you can go look and be part of. Then of course there's the location. You arrive at what seems like a seemingly nondescript locale only to be ultimately blown away with what awaits you when entering the doors to the main house. Walk along their path to the sea . Your eyes will constantly be readjusting. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Run don't walk to this slice of paradise.        "
300,  The food was exceptional -- the tasting menu was a treat. Breakfast is amazing.     Areas do Seixo was truly a special place. It seemed that every detail was attended to with great care. The d�cor and surroundings and location really made it feel relaxing
301,"     ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I spent one night in this hotel and what an hotel so we came and played the bell to enter :) we are presented with two rocking chairs in the reception where we make a brief check in without big wastes of time, just the essentials. We are invited to have tea with produce grown in Horta Hotel. Magnify!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But when we entered the room and in this case ours was Jasmin went into a transe that wonderful space, huge but very cozy, always with background music, the furniture forget it, all made and designed with many feelings to the mix bet. Everything has a meaning and implicit feeling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then we were invited to join us at the Fire Circle, where we had a bonfire and several vancos made by trunks where we drank a glass of wine and we get to know the other guests and even employees.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The perfect phrase several times and said the same: ""Feel at home"" and it was exactly how I felt and loved everything, every detail, so simple and so magnanimous at the same time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No doubt an experience to repeat and get to a new room!        "
302,"     It was the second time that we had the pleasure of staying at Areas do Seixo Hotel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything is magical and unique. The integration with the nature is absolute amazing! We are truly passionate with this place! Perfect for relax, enjoy life and feel everything around us. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The small olive room at the first stay was very good but now the Neha cretcheu room is simply amazing. The smell, the music, the jacuzzi are lovely. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If the perfection exists, it is at Areas do Seixo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From truly passionate guests.        "
303," The breakfast service is very friendly, and picturesque quality to be served in the kitchen. It gives an interesting transparency and involves guests and staff.    I received a gift night for dating birthday and I must say I was absolutely dazzled. I've met several hotels, in and out of Portugal, and this went directly to the top of my preferences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Impeccably decorated space, ecological sustainability and environmental strongly emphasized within and surroundings. Informal service but very friendly in general. Hospitable and welcoming: with bit like a slice of homemade cake and a direct tea garden, make my well Recber delights. The decor is sublime. The fireplace invite you to linger is on summer nights, here are never scorching, and at the peak of winter. The rooms and the concept of exclusivity are well achieved, there is a parallel between the two rooms, the bedroom and living area and the bathroom, making it difficult to choose which of the two spend more time. Natural light through the skylight right above the bath tub create a fantastic environment.,,,,,,,,,,
In short, all the space in this hotel is decorated with care and engaging. The interior trees, the prevalence of wood, slate and the knowledge that there are written, everything converges in a listed building environment is charming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything else, applause.   In my opinion, the only experience that left me disappointed was the restaurant. Since we choose for dinner the tasting menu, did not exceed expectations. In fact, I dare say that in 8 black and 3 desserts no one that would give me a taste experience, a shame that the hotel deserved a walk kitchen, in line with the space. The filing this edge. And, concomitantly, turns out to be unpleasant to the price, exorbitant charged. It would be an even higher price for a sublime tasting, ever fair for what is served. There is an effort by the gourmet and nouvelle cuisine, but does not match. It's worth thinking about it.     "
304,"     How can I start to even describe the magic of this place. The building is just breathtaking out of a magazine. Everything here is meant for you to relax and rest. The pool is plain gorgeous. The rooms are incredible with massive bathrooms like you've never seen. The beach is just steps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Away. We had a dream stay        "
305,"     After 3 days in the center of Lisbon, we escaped the baking heat and after a hour-long Uber ride arrived here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First impressions count and the place is stunning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every aspect of the hotel, the productive fields, is presented beautifully. From the concrete walls to the piped music, the hotel oozes quiet confidence - it is the most perfect place to relax.        "
306,     The most amazing time there. Everything is wonderful and very delicious. Lovely service team. Everyone does their best to give you the best vacation. Bikes can be borrowed free of charge
307,"     An experience not to be missed, no doubt. The prime location on the seafront, Calm and serenity that sits in the hotel, the friendliness of the staff, the 4th huge, super comfortable, refined decoration. Breakfast is great. We made the Floral Massage and I can say it was the best massage I've ever done. It's expensive for our bags everyday, but nothing expensive for the quality it offers.        "
308,     I married here last 4th July. Everything ran smoothly since the day we schedule our big day
309," The successive meals we had here alone justify the price of the room. The staff were friendly, knowledgeable and it was easily the most welcoming experience we have had recently. Special mention to the three who ran the place during the evening, and the lovely chefs who brought course after course of food they were proud to serve.     Hotel is beautiful, rooms are stunning. The best part of the hotel for us was the restaurant. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Would definitely recommend this place for a two night stay.        The only minor critique (1) the rooms do not have air-conditioning and it gets hot. Sleeping with the door open is not really an option as there is no screen to stop the mosquitoes coming in, and (2) we stayed during a very busy period and as such, there was a massive shortage of deck chairs / couches by the pool. Many people were sitting on the grass as a result. This seems like an easy fix given the magnificent space and breath-taking views."
310,     Fantastic place. Very relaxing. Lost a years worth of wedding planning stress looking over the Atlantic. Everyone there is truly helpful
311,     Hotel of great originality that can not be ignored: a boho style green in an offset environment. Decorative work of highly sought rooms and staging room before the friendly night (candles
312," We should also note the restaurant is the responsibility of Leonardo Pereira (former Nomad), which is a kitchen inspiration Nordic / Scandinavian and here they cast soil. I had experienced another time the tasting menu, a lunch, but this time we had dinner.    As can be seen in any review and multiple sites, this is in fact a single magic place. Hats off to those who developed the concept and thought the space, along with the decor and service are absolutely fabulous. Everything is thought to make us feel good and relaxed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The staff are extremely friendly and available. Very recommended.   It should be noted, however, that the restaurant was full and the room service could not keep up with the requests and failed on several occasions, with long wait times, among other problems. But nothing to tarnish the overall experience.     "
313,"     Hotel, location, catering, decoration, home. Everything is perfect for a romantic moment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The restaurant is beautiful and you feel at ease quickly.   Attention to dust as polished concrete floor.      Only weak point, the city in itself, but the place is charming."
314,     We arrived at Areas in the late afternoon and immediately felt a sense of relaxation. The architecture and design are amazing�concrete
315,"     Possible the best hotel I've had in my life! For me the details make the difference and more small. This hotel is full of great little details that make it contagious nice cozy single special and leave us with a feeling that only the Portuguese can explain, Saudade! !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Congratulations to the administrators for building in Portugal something so charming and with people at all concerned ... with the detail!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

399,"As you know we have just returned home after 5 days at Areias do Seixo.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We would like the management at Areias do Seixo to know what brilliant customer service we received from Joanna.  We had a major issue with our room on the first night.  The following morning Joanna made sure she found us and sorted the problem face to face with us by moving our room, something we were very grateful for.  We were very impressed with her professionalism and she certainly made our stay with you wonderful and because of her it is a place to which we will return.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We would be very grateful if you would pass on our sincere thanks to Joanna and I hope the management recognize what as asset she is to your company.             "
400,"    SPA is excellent. I worked only with one lady several times, and again � she is among the top 5% of my personal rating (I am a big client of many massage techniques in many cities and resorts). It was a really great stay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am impressed by the quality of the place and great hospitality of your people. This is something you can rarely meet, and they are so great!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We received great support for my small son with allergy, and also a lot of fun and warmth from all the team � ladies at reception and gentlemen in the restaurant. We felt like we are with friends, they knew us by names, remembered our breakfast preferences and so on. My son did not want to leave � this is the first time in his life ?.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will be happy to do an event or come back to you with my family again.        "
